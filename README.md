# Math-and-Universe
An old scrapped project I did for my university. Contains a placeholder picture used randomly from a Google search, I own no rights to it. It was subject to change but when I decided not to pursue this, it stayed as this.

for my old project archival's sake. This repo is already a windows build. I deleted the source repo out of repulsiveness (exaggerated but can't find any other word with the same meaning).
